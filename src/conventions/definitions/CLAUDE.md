# Convention Definitions

Convention bundles that each implement a bridge bidding convention using the meaning pipeline. Each bundle is self-contained with deal constraints, meaning surfaces, fact extensions, convention modules (`ConventionModule`), and teaching metadata.

## Folder Structure

**Shared files** (at `definitions/` root):
- `teaching-vocabulary.ts` — 6 general-purpose tags (`SAME_FAMILY`, `STRONGER_THAN`, `CONTINUATION_OF`, `NEAR_MISS_OF`, `FALLBACK_OF`, `ALTERNATIVES`). Modules annotate surfaces with these + a scope string to express any pedagogical relationship.
- `derive-cross-module.ts` — `deriveTeachingContent(modules)` — derives all pedagogical relations, alternatives, and intent families from `teachingTags` on surfaces. Groups by `(tagId, scope)`. Supports ordinal chains for strength progressions. Called by `aggregateModuleContent()` in `system-registry.ts`.
- `surface-group-vocabulary.ts` — *(Removed. Cross-module surface groupIds are now defined locally in modules.)*
- `pedagogical-scope-vocabulary.ts` — Type-safe scope constants (branded `PedagogicalScope` type) for `teachingTags` scopes. Replaces free-form strings.
- `system-registry.ts` — Bundle registry. Stores `BundleInput` definitions (no modules, no deal constraints). `getBundleInput(id)`, `listBundleInputs()`, `resolveBundle(input, sys)` (resolves modules + derives deal constraints for a SystemConfig), `specFromBundle(input, sys)`. Pre-resolved bundle constants (`ntBundle`, `bergenBundle`, etc.) live in each bundle's own `config.ts`.
- `derive-deal-constraints.ts` — `deriveBundleDealConstraints(input, modules, sys)` — derives deal constraints from capability archetype + R1 surface clause analysis + complement negation. Called by `resolveBundle()`.
- `capability-constraint-registry.ts` — Maps each capability ID to a `CapabilityArchetype` defining opener constraints, default auction, allowed dealers, and practitioner turn/seat.
- `module-registry.ts` — Convention module registry.
- `capability-vocabulary.ts` — Stable host-attachment capability IDs (`CAP_OPENING_1NT`, `CAP_OPENING_MAJOR`, `CAP_OPENING_WEAK_TWO`, `CAP_OPPONENT_1NT`).
- `system-fact-vocabulary.ts` (in `core/contracts/`) — System-provided fact IDs that modules reference for system-dependent thresholds and properties. Modules import these IDs, never concrete system configs.

**Architectural rule:** ALL pedagogical content (relations, alternatives, intent families) — both intra-module and cross-module — is derived from `teachingTags` on surfaces. `ConventionModule` has no `teachingRelations`, `alternatives`, or `intentFamilies` fields. Modules are portable building blocks: compose any set into a bundle and pedagogical content derives automatically. Do not create standalone `pedagogical-relations.ts` or `alternatives.ts` files.

4 convention bundles: `nt-bundle/`, `bergen-bundle/`, `weak-twos-bundle/`, `dont-bundle/`. Each folder has a parallel set of modules:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `config.ts` | Pre-resolved SAYC bundle constant via `resolveBundle(getBundleInput(...), SAYC_SYSTEM_CONFIG)` |
| `meaning-surfaces.ts` | `BidMeaning[]` definitions — the core bidding logic (single-module bundles). In multi-module bundles like nt-bundle, this is `composed-surfaces.ts` (cross-module composition re-exports). |
| `facts.ts` | `FactCatalogExtension`s for module-derived facts. Use factory helpers from `core/pipeline/fact-factory.ts` for common patterns. |
| `semantic-classes.ts` | Module-local semantic class constants (not in central registry) |
| `system-profile.ts` | `SystemProfile` for profile-based module activation |
| `explanation-catalog.ts` | `ExplanationCatalog` entries for teaching projections |
| `module.ts` | *(dont-bundle, weak-twos-bundle only)* Single-module convention definition |
| `index.ts` | Barrel exports |
| `__tests__/` | Bundle-specific tests |


**`nt-bundle/`** — Bottom-up composition of Stayman + Jacoby Transfers + Smolen + Natural NT into a single 1NT response bundle. Each convention is a self-contained `ConventionModule` in `modules/`; modules are assembled in `module-registry.ts` from raw parts (facts/explanations from module files, LocalFsm/Rules from rules files).
- `modules/` — Convention modules (source of truth for all bidding logic):
  - `stayman.ts` — Stayman convention: facts + explanation entries. Factory returns `{ facts, explanationEntries }`.
  - `jacoby-transfers.ts` — Jacoby Transfers convention: facts + explanation entries. Factory returns `{ facts, explanationEntries }`.
  - `smolen.ts` — Smolen convention: facts + explanation entries. Factory returns `{ facts, explanationEntries }`.
  - `natural-nt.ts` — Natural NT responses: facts + explanation entries. Factory returns `{ facts, explanationEntries }`.
  - `natural-nt-rules.ts` — LocalFsm + StateEntry[] for natural-nt (phases: idle/opened/responded). No negotiationDelta needed (INITIAL_NEGOTIATION correct for opening/R1).
  - `stayman-rules.ts` — LocalFsm + StateEntry[] for Stayman (phases: idle/asked/shown-hearts/shown-spades/denied/inactive). Claims carry `negotiationDelta` for forcing/captain effects.
  - `jacoby-transfers-rules.ts` — LocalFsm + StateEntry[] for Jacoby Transfers (phases: idle/inactive/transferred-*/accepted-*/placing-*/invited-*). Claims carry `negotiationDelta` for forcing/fitAgreed/captain effects.
  - `smolen-rules.ts` — LocalFsm + StateEntry[] for Smolen (phases: idle/post-r1/placing-hearts/placing-spades/done). Claims carry `negotiationDelta` for game-forcing/fitAgreed/captain effects. Proof case: uses route pattern `subseq([inquire(majorSuit), deny(majorSuit)])` instead of hookTransitions.
- `config.ts` — Re-exports `ntBundle` from `system-registry.ts`.
- `sub-bundles.ts` — Stayman-only and Transfer-only pre-resolved SAYC sub-bundle constants via `resolveBundle(getBundleInput(...), SAYC_SYSTEM_CONFIG)`.
- `composed-surfaces.ts` — Cross-module composition re-exports. `RESPONDER_SURFACES` assembled from modules; individual arrays re-exported from owning modules.
- `semantic-classes.ts` — Re-export shim from modules.
- `explanation-catalog.ts` — Composed from all modules' explanation entries.

**`bergen-bundle/`** — Bergen Raises using the meaning pipeline with `$suit` binding parameterization for hearts and spades.
- `config.ts` — `ConventionBundle` with `meaningSurfaces` (13 groups), `factExtensions`, `modules`. `memberIds: ["bergen-raises"]`. `internal: true` (parity testing). Activation handled by `systemProfile: BERGEN_PROFILE`.
- `meaning-surfaces.ts` — `createBergenR1Surfaces(suit)` factory producing 5 surfaces per suit (splinter, game, limit, constructive, preemptive) parameterized by `$suit` bindings. Also includes R2–R4 surfaces.
- `facts.ts` — 1 `FactCatalogExtension`: `bergenFacts` for `module.bergen.hasMajorSupport` (hearts ≥ 4 or spades ≥ 4). Uses `buildExtension()` from fact-factory.
- `modules/bergen/bergen-rules.ts` — LocalFsm + StateEntry[] for Bergen (15 phases: idle/opened-H/S/after-constructive-H/S/after-limit-H/S/after-preemptive-H/S/after-game/after-signoff/after-game-try-H/S/r4/done). Includes stub 1H/1S opening surfaces with `MajorOpen` intent for phase transitions. Claims carry captain/fitAgreed kernel deltas.

## Convention Quick Reference

- **NT Bundle (1NT Responses):** Stayman (2C ask for 4-card majors) + Jacoby Transfers (2D→hearts, 2H→spades) + Smolen (3H/3S game-forcing after 2D denial with 5-4 majors). 35 meaning surfaces, 4 fact extensions, 15-state hierarchical FSM with per-module scope states (`stayman-scope`, `transfers-scope`, `smolen-scope`) for scoped opponent interrupts + 5-state Smolen submachine (first real convention to use submachine invocation with guard-based routing). Deal constraints: opener 15–17 HCP balanced, responder 6+ HCP with 4+ in any major.
- **Bergen Bundle (Bergen Raises):** Responder raises after 1M opening. Standard Bergen variant (3C=constructive 7–10, 3D=limit 10–12, 3M=preemptive 0–6, splinter 12+). `$suit` binding factory for DRY heart/spade parameterization. Deal constraints: opener 12–21 HCP with 5+ major, responder 0+ HCP with 4+ major.
- **Weak Two Bundle:** Weak Two openings (2D/2H/2S) with Ogust responses. `modules/weak-twos/weak-twos-rules.ts` — LocalFsm + StateEntry[] (11 phases: idle/opened-H/S/D/ogust-asked-H/S/D/post-ogust-H/S/D/done). Ogust ask carries `forcing: "one-round"` kernel delta. Deal constraints: opener 5–10 HCP with 6+ in a suit, responder 12+ HCP.
- **DONT Bundle (Disturbing Opponent's No Trump):** Competitive overcalls after opponent's 1NT. `modules/dont/dont-rules.ts` — LocalFsm + StateEntry[] (11 phases: idle/r1/after-2h/2d/2c/2s/double/wait-reveal/wait-2d-relay/wait-2c-relay/done). **No `match.turn`** — uses phase + route scoping because `deriveTurnRole()` classifies the overcaller as "opponent". Includes stub 1NT opening surface for phase transitions. 9 surface groups, 24 surfaces, 21 facts. Deal constraints: East 15–17 HCP (NT opener), South 8–15 HCP with 5+ in any suit.

## Convention Bundle Completeness Checklist

Every convention bundle must satisfy all items before being considered complete:

1. **`meaningSurfaces` with grouped surfaces.** At least one surface group with `groupId` and `surfaces` array. Every surface needs `meaningId`, `encoding`, `clauses` (with `factId`, `operator`, `value`), and `ranking` (`band`, `declarationOrder`). `modulePrecedence` defaults to 0 — do NOT set it on surfaces. **Specificity is pipeline-derived from the communicative dimensions of the surface's clauses** — do NOT set it on surfaces. All `FactDefinition` objects must declare `constrainsDimensions` (required field).
2. **`factExtensions` for module-derived facts.** Any fact referenced in surface clauses that isn't in the shared `BRIDGE_DERIVED_FACTS` must be defined in a `FactCatalogExtension` in `facts.ts`. Evaluators must be pure functions of hand/auction state. Use factory helpers (`defineBooleanFact`, `definePerSuitFacts`, `defineHcpRangeFact`, `buildExtension`) from `core/pipeline/fact-factory.ts` for common patterns.
3. **`modules` for surface selection.** `ConventionModule[]` with `local` (LocalFsm: phases + phase transitions) and `states` (StateEntry[]: phase + turn role + optional route/kernel constraints + surfaces). The rule interpreter (`collectMatchingClaims()`) handles surface selection. Modules are resolved by `buildBundle()` from `memberIds` via module-registry.
4. **`systemProfile` for activation.** Profile-based module activation via `SystemProfile`.
6. **`declaredCapabilities` for deal constraint derivation.** Declare the bundle's capability (e.g., `CAP_OPENING_1NT`) so `deriveBundleDealConstraints()` can derive opener constraints, default auction, and allowed dealers from the capability archetype registry. Deal constraints are NOT hand-authored — they are derived from capabilities + R1 surface analysis.
7. **`category` and `description` are required** on `ConventionBundle`. `registerBundle()` auto-derives `ConventionConfig` — no separate wrapper needed.
8. **`explanationCatalog` entries.** Template-keyed explanations for teaching projections. Each entry links a `factId` to display text and contrastive templates.
9. **`systemProfile` IR.** Profile-based module activation metadata.
10. **`teachingTags` on surfaces.** All surfaces participating in pedagogical relations or grading alternatives must have `teachingTags` annotations using the 6 general tags from `teaching-vocabulary.ts`. No separate `pedagogical-relations.ts` or `alternatives.ts` files.
12. **`semantic-classes.ts` constants.** Module-local semantic class strings. Do not add to central registry — keep them co-located with the surfaces that reference them.

## File Templates

See `docs/convention-templates.md` for skeleton code templates (config.ts, meaning-surfaces.ts, facts.ts, rules.ts, semantic-classes.ts, system-profile.ts, explanation-catalog.ts).

## Adding a New Convention Bundle

1. Create `definitions/{name}-bundle/` folder with the modules listed in the Folder Structure table above.
2. Define `BidMeaning[]` in `meaning-surfaces.ts`. Each surface needs `meaningId`, `encoding` (the `Call`), `clauses` (fact-based conditions), `semanticClass`, and `ranking`. Use the factory pattern with `$suit` bindings when parameterizing across suits.
3. Define `FactCatalogExtension`s in `facts.ts` for any module-specific facts referenced by surface clauses. Use factory helpers from `core/pipeline/fact-factory.ts` for common patterns.
4. Define module-local semantic class constants in `semantic-classes.ts`.
5. Define `LocalFsm` and `StateEntry[]` in `{name}-rules.ts`. Declare phases, phase transitions (observation patterns that advance the local FSM), and state entries (phase + turn + optional route/kernel constraints + surfaces). The module-registry assembles these into a `ConventionModule`.
6. Define `SystemProfile` in `system-profile.ts`.
7. Populate `ExplanationCatalog` in `explanation-catalog.ts` with template-keyed explanations.
8. Add `teachingTags` to surfaces using the 6 general tags from `teaching-vocabulary.ts`. Use scope strings to group related surfaces.
9. Wire `config.ts` as a thin re-export from `system-registry.ts`.
10. Create `index.ts` barrel with re-exports.
11. Register the module in `module-registry.ts` and define the bundle in `system-registry.ts` via `buildBundle()`.
12. Create `__tests__/` with at minimum: surface evaluation tests and config/factory E2E tests.
13. **Verify:** `npm run lint` (boundary violations), `npm run test:run` (all tests), `npx tsx src/cli/main.ts selftest` (pipeline selftest).
14. Run the completeness checklist above before considering the bundle complete.

## Authoring Rules

- **Use `createSurface()` for all new surfaces.** Import from `conventions/core/surface-builder.ts` with a `ModuleContext`. The builder derives `clauseId` and `description` automatically. Provide `description` only when it adds parenthetical rationale beyond the mechanical constraint (test: contains `(`). `moduleId` is injected from `ModuleContext`. `modulePrecedence` defaults to 0 — not hand-authored.
- **Modules are portable.** A module must work in any bundle. Never import from other modules. Never reference foreign surface IDs. Use `teachingTags` with shared vocabulary scopes for cross-module relationships.
- **Adding a module must not edit existing modules.** If your new module needs to relate to existing ones (same-family, near-miss, etc.), use shared scope strings in `teachingTags`. The derivation function handles the wiring.
- **Cross-module groupIds must use shared constants.** Never use string literals for groupIds that another module also references.
- **Use scope constants from `pedagogical-scope-vocabulary.ts`** for `teachingTags` scopes. The branded `PedagogicalScope` type catches typos at compile time. Do not use free-form strings.
- **Generalize before specializing.** When a convention needs a capability that doesn't exist in `core/`, design the solution to work for any convention — not just yours. If the abstraction only makes sense for one convention, it belongs in `definitions/{name}-bundle/`, not in `core/`.
- **Module-derived facts must have `composition`.** All `FactDefinition` objects with `layer: FactLayer.ModuleDerived` must declare a `composition` field describing the loosest constraint under which the fact could be true. The composition is used by deal constraint derivation to derive practitioner seat constraints from R1 surface clauses. Convention authors should write the LOOSEST correct composition — it does not need to be semantically equivalent to the evaluator. Factory helpers (`defineBooleanFact`, `defineHcpRangeFact`) auto-populate composition. Hand-written evaluators must add composition manually.
- **System-fact-gated surfaces for cross-system modules.** When a bid has different meanings in different systems (e.g., jump shift: strong in SAYC, weak in 2/1), author surfaces for ALL meanings in the same module. Gate each with a system fact clause (`{ factId: SYSTEM_SUIT_RESPONSE_IS_GAME_FORCING, operator: "eq", value: true/false }`). The pipeline evaluates all surfaces and selects only those matching the active `SystemConfig`. Never create system-specific modules or branch on `systemId` in module code.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Surface clause `factId` not in catalog.** Every `factId` referenced in a surface clause must either be in the shared `BRIDGE_DERIVED_FACTS` or defined in a `FactCatalogExtension` in `facts.ts`. Missing facts cause clauses to fail closed (treated as not satisfied).

2. **Reusing `meaningId` across surfaces.** Each surface must have a unique `meaningId`. Duplicates cause unpredictable surface selection.

3. **`$suit` binding errors in parameterized surfaces.** When using the factory pattern (like Bergen's `createBergenR1Surfaces(suit)`), clauses must reference the binding variable (e.g., `hand.suitLength.$suit`) and the surface must include a `bindings: { suit }` field. Missing bindings cause clause evaluation to fail.

4. **Missing `category` or `description` on bundle.** Both are required on `ConventionBundle`. `registerBundle()` auto-derives `ConventionConfig` from these fields.

5. **Hand-authoring clauseId/description in surfaces.** These are auto-derived by the builder and pipeline. Only provide `description` when adding convention-specific rationale in parentheses.

6. **Semantic class IDs are module-local.** Define them in `{bundle}/semantic-classes.ts`, not in the central `BRIDGE_SEMANTIC_CLASSES`. Adding a convention does NOT require editing the central registry.

7. **Phase transition vs route matching confusion.** Phase transitions (`phaseTransitions` in LocalFsm) advance the local FSM state — they are actor-agnostic and fire on observation shape. Route matching (`RouteExpr` in rules) filters which surfaces are active — it supports actor-aware patterns. Do not conflate the two.

## Boundary Contract

Adding a new convention is a **definitions-only** change. The following directories must NOT be modified:

| Directory | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| `src/engine/` | Bridge engine types/logic are convention-agnostic |
| `src/strategy/` | Strategy layer consumes bundles generically via `meaningBundleToStrategy()` |
| `src/conventions/teaching/` | Teaching system reads `ExplanationCatalog` and `TeachingRelation[]` from bundles |
| `src/service/` | Service layer is convention-agnostic orchestration |
| `src/stores/` | Stores bind to the convention registry, not individual conventions |
| `src/components/` | UI renders from generic `ConventionConfig` and `DecisionSurfaceEntry[]` |
| `src/conventions/core/` | Pipeline infrastructure is convention-universal (see `core/CLAUDE.md`) |
| `src/core/contracts/` | Shared contracts are stable; adding a new fact type is a separate task |

If any of these need changes to support a new convention, the boundary has leaked and the core architecture should be fixed instead. ESLint import boundaries enforce this at build time -- a convention that compiles and passes lint has respected the contract.

## Design Decisions

- **Why ConventionConfig is kept as a separate DTO:** UI/stores should consume minimal types, not full pipeline bundles with 20+ fields. ConventionConfig is the stable UI contract — auto-derived by `registerBundle()`.
- **Why explicit registration over auto-discovery:** Explicit `registerBundle()` calls are traceable and debuggable. Auto-discovery adds implicit ordering and makes registration non-obvious.
- **Why two layers (Bundle → Config) not three:** BiddingSystem added no fields or behavior that ConventionBundle didn't already provide. The indirection created wiring fragility without architectural benefit.
- **Why PedagogicalScope lives in definitions, not contracts:** Scope strings are convention-specific vocabulary. Contracts contains only convention-agnostic types. Enforcement via scope constants catches errors at authoring time without polluting the contracts tier.

## Context Maintenance

**After modifying files in this directory:** scan the entries above — if any claim is now
false or incomplete, update this file before ending the task. Do not defer.

**Staleness anchor:** This file assumes `nt-bundle/config.ts`, `bergen-bundle/config.ts`, `weak-twos-bundle/config.ts`, and `dont-bundle/config.ts` exist.
If any is missing, this file is stale — update or regenerate before relying on it.
