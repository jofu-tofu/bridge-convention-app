# Convention Definitions

Convention bundles that each implement a bridge bidding convention using the meaning pipeline. Each bundle is self-contained with deal constraints, meaning surfaces, fact extensions, convention modules (`ConventionModule`), and teaching metadata.

## Folder Structure

**Shared files** (at `definitions/` root):
- `system-registry.ts` — Bundle registry + base system profiles. Stores `BundleInput` definitions (no modules, no deal constraints). `getBundleInput(id)`, `listBundleInputs()`, `resolveBundle(input, sys)` (resolves modules + derives deal constraints for a SystemConfig), `specFromBundle(input, sys)` (merges base system modules into the spec), `specFromSystem(baseSystemId)` (all registered modules for a system). Also contains `BaseSystemProfile`, `getBaseModuleIds()`, and `deriveSurfaceGroupsFromModules()` which auto-derives `SurfaceGroup`s from module state structure. Pre-resolved bundle constants (`ntBundle`, `bergenBundle`, etc.) live in each bundle's own `config.ts`.
- `derive-deal-constraints.ts` — `deriveBundleDealConstraints(input, modules, sys)` — derives deal constraints from capability archetype + R1 surface clause analysis + complement negation. Called by `resolveBundle()`.
- `capability-constraint-registry.ts` — Maps each capability ID to a `CapabilityArchetype` defining opener constraints, default auction, allowed dealers, and practitioner turn/seat. `archetypeSupportsRoleSelection()` derives whether a convention supports opener/responder role selection from archetype partnership membership.
- `module-registry.ts` — Convention module registry.
- `capability-vocabulary.ts` — Stable host-attachment capability IDs (`CAP_OPENING_1NT`, `CAP_OPENING_MAJOR`, `CAP_OPENING_WEAK_TWO`, `CAP_OPPONENT_1NT`).
- `system-config.ts` — Merged from former `core/contracts/system-config.ts` + `core/contracts/base-system-vocabulary.ts`. Contains `BaseSystemId`, `BASE_SYSTEM_SAYC`, `BASE_SYSTEM_TWO_OVER_ONE`, `BASE_SYSTEM_ACOL`, `SystemConfig`, `TotalPointEquivalent` (trump = shortage-based TP, nt = display-only Profiles screen reference — NOT used at runtime), concrete system configs (`SAYC_SYSTEM_CONFIG`, etc.), `getSystemConfig()`, `AVAILABLE_BASE_SYSTEMS`.
- `system-fact-vocabulary.ts` — System-provided fact IDs that modules reference for system-dependent thresholds and properties. Modules import these IDs, never concrete system configs. Moved from former `core/contracts/`.

**Base system modules** (at `definitions/modules/` root, not inside any bundle):
- `modules/natural-nt/` — Standard non-alertable bids: natural openings and notrump responses. Module ID is `"natural-bids"`. **Gotcha:** Module ID is `"natural-bids"` but directory is `modules/natural-nt/` — temporary mismatch, directory rename is a separate follow-up. Base-only module: not a member of any bundle's `memberIds`. Files: `ids.ts`, `meaning-surfaces.ts`, `explanation-catalog.ts`, `index.ts`.
- `modules/blackwood/` — Blackwood 4NT ace-asking convention. Base system module: always active via `BaseSystemProfile`, never a bundle member. Files: `ids.ts`, `meaning-surfaces.ts`, `facts.ts`, `explanation-catalog.ts`, `index.ts`.

**Base module defaults:** Each base system profile includes 4 always-active modules: `["natural-bids", "stayman", "jacoby-transfers", "blackwood"]`. These are merged via `specFromBundle()` (strategy layer) using `Set` deduplication. Base modules are never in a bundle's `memberIds` — bundles represent practice targets only. Inert modules are harmless — e.g., Stayman/Jacoby FSMs never activate during Bergen practice because `open(notrump)` never fires.

**Bergen/natural-bids interaction:** natural-bids provides canonical 1H/1S opening surfaces with real clauses (HCP + suit length → higher specificity). Bergen has stub 1H/1S opening surfaces (zero clauses). Arbitration picks natural-bids's surface. Bergen's FSM still advances correctly because `advanceLocalFsm()` matches on observations (`{ act: "open", strain: "hearts" }`), not surface ownership.

**`resolveBundle`/`specFromBundle` asymmetry:** `resolveBundle()` must NOT merge base module IDs. It drives deal constraints via `deriveBundleDealConstraints()` and teaching content via `deriveSurfaceGroupsFromModules()`. Adding base modules there would generate slam-zone deals during Stayman practice and pollute teaching groups. Base modules are merged only in `specFromBundle()` (strategy layer).

**Architectural rule:** Pedagogical content is auto-derived from module structure. Surface groups come from `deriveSurfaceGroupsFromModules()` (state entries with 2+ surfaces). Cross-module alternatives are handled by `truthSetCalls` in `teaching-resolution.ts`. No manual teaching tags, scope annotations, or derivation files needed. Modules are portable building blocks.

4 convention bundles: `nt-bundle/`, `bergen-bundle/`, `weak-twos-bundle/`, `dont-bundle/`. Each folder has a parallel set of modules:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `config.ts` | Pre-resolved SAYC bundle constant via `resolveBundle(getBundleInput(...), SAYC_SYSTEM_CONFIG)` |
| `meaning-surfaces.ts` | `BidMeaning[]` definitions — the core bidding logic (single-module bundles). In multi-module bundles like nt-bundle, this is `composed-surfaces.ts` (cross-module composition re-exports). |
| `facts.ts` | `FactCatalogExtension`s for module-derived facts. Use factory helpers from `conventions/pipeline/fact-factory.ts` for common patterns. |
| `semantic-classes.ts` | Module-local semantic class constants (not in central registry) |
| `system-profile.ts` | `SystemProfile` for profile-based module activation |
| `explanation-catalog.ts` | `ExplanationCatalog` entries for teaching projections |
| `ids.ts` | `as const` typed ID constants for all module-derived fact IDs and meaning IDs (merged from former separate `fact-ids.ts` + `meaning-ids.ts` + `semantic-classes.ts`) |
| `module.ts` | *(dont-bundle, weak-twos-bundle only)* Single-module convention definition |
| `index.ts` | Barrel exports |
| `__tests__/` | Bundle-specific tests |


**`nt-bundle/`** — Bottom-up composition of Stayman + Jacoby Transfers + Smolen + Natural NT into a single 1NT response bundle. Each convention is a self-contained `ConventionModule` in `modules/`; modules are assembled in `module-registry.ts` from raw parts (facts/explanations from module files, LocalFsm/Rules from rules files).
- `modules/` — Convention modules (source of truth for all bidding logic):
  - `stayman.ts` — Stayman convention: facts + explanation entries. Factory returns `{ facts, explanationEntries }`.
  - `jacoby-transfers.ts` — Jacoby Transfers convention: facts + explanation entries. Factory returns `{ facts, explanationEntries }`.
  - `smolen.ts` — Smolen convention: facts + explanation entries. Factory returns `{ facts, explanationEntries }`.
  - `natural-nt/` — Standard non-alertable bids module (module ID: `"natural-bids"`, directory rename deferred). Base-only — not a member of nt-bundle. Self-contained with `index.ts` (moduleFactory, FSM phases: idle/opened-nt/opened-suit/responded), `meaning-surfaces.ts` (1NT + suit opening surfaces), `ids.ts`, `explanation-catalog.ts`.
  - `stayman-rules.ts` — LocalFsm + StateEntry[] for Stayman (phases: idle/asked/shown-hearts/shown-spades/denied/inactive). Claims carry `negotiationDelta` for forcing/captain effects.
  - `jacoby-transfers-rules.ts` — LocalFsm + StateEntry[] for Jacoby Transfers (phases: idle/inactive/transferred-*/accepted-*/placing-*/invited-*). Claims carry `negotiationDelta` for forcing/fitAgreed/captain effects.
  - `smolen-rules.ts` — LocalFsm + StateEntry[] for Smolen (phases: idle/post-r1/placing-hearts/placing-spades/accepted-spades/done). Claims carry `negotiationDelta` for game-forcing/fitAgreed/captain effects. Proof case: uses route pattern `subseq([inquire(majorSuit), deny(majorSuit)])` instead of hookTransitions.
- `config.ts` — Re-exports `ntBundle` from `system-registry.ts`.
- `sub-bundles.ts` — Stayman-only and Transfer-only pre-resolved SAYC sub-bundle constants via `resolveBundle(getBundleInput(...), SAYC_SYSTEM_CONFIG)`.
- `composed-surfaces.ts` — Cross-module composition re-exports. `RESPONDER_SURFACES` assembled from modules; individual arrays re-exported from owning modules.
- `semantic-classes.ts` — Re-export shim from modules.
- `explanation-catalog.ts` — Composed from all modules' explanation entries.

**`bergen-bundle/`** — Bergen Raises using the meaning pipeline with `$suit` binding parameterization for hearts and spades.
- `config.ts` — `ConventionBundle` with `meaningSurfaces` (13 groups), `factExtensions`, `modules`. `memberIds: ["bergen-raises"]`. `internal: true` (parity testing). Activation handled by `systemProfile: BERGEN_PROFILE`.
- `meaning-surfaces.ts` — `createBergenR1Surfaces(suit)` factory producing 5 surfaces per suit (splinter, game, limit, constructive, preemptive) parameterized by `$suit` bindings. Also includes R2–R4 surfaces.
- `facts.ts` — 1 `FactCatalogExtension`: `bergenFacts` for `module.bergen.hasMajorSupport` (hearts ≥ 4 or spades ≥ 4). Uses `buildExtension()` from fact-factory.
- `modules/bergen/bergen-rules.ts` — LocalFsm + StateEntry[] for Bergen (15 phases: idle/opened-H/S/after-constructive-H/S/after-limit-H/S/after-preemptive-H/S/after-game/after-signoff/after-game-try-H/S/r4/done). Includes stub 1H/1S opening surfaces with `MajorOpen` intent for phase transitions. Claims carry captain/fitAgreed kernel deltas.

## Boundary Contract

Adding a new convention is a **definitions-only** change. The following directories must NOT be modified:

| Directory | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| `src/engine/` | Bridge engine types/logic are convention-agnostic |
| `src/strategy/` | Strategy layer consumes bundles generically via `meaningBundleToStrategy()` |
| `src/conventions/teaching/` | Teaching system reads `ExplanationCatalog` and `SurfaceGroup[]` from bundles |
| `src/service/` | Service layer is convention-agnostic orchestration |
| `src/stores/` | Stores bind to the convention registry, not individual conventions |
| `src/components/` | UI renders from generic `ConventionConfig` and `DecisionSurfaceEntry[]` |
| `src/conventions/core/` | Pipeline infrastructure is convention-universal (see `core/CLAUDE.md`) |

If any of these need changes to support a new convention, the boundary has leaked and the core architecture should be fixed instead. ESLint import boundaries enforce this at build time -- a convention that compiles and passes lint has respected the contract.

## Context Maintenance

**After modifying files in this directory:** scan the entries above — if any claim is now
false or incomplete, update this file before ending the task. Do not defer.

**Staleness anchor:** This file assumes `nt-bundle/config.ts`, `bergen-bundle/config.ts`, `weak-twos-bundle/config.ts`, and `dont-bundle/config.ts` exist.
If any is missing, this file is stale — update or regenerate before relying on it.
