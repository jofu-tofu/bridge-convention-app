If all four criteria are met and an agent with zero conversation history could verify the task was completed, return ok:true. If any criterion is missing, return ok:false with a response like: 'Missing context: [list each gap — e.g., no file path specified for the auth module, expected behavior is vague: what does fix the bug mean specifically, compound task should be split into separate criteria]'. When returning ok:false, end your response with: 'Retry: Re-invoke TaskCreate with a revised subject and description that address the gaps above.'

NOT violations: relative paths ('_output/', 'src/lib/'), search terms ('context-manager', 'auth module'), directory exploration ('find files matching X'), tool names, or any concrete noun — even if imprecise. Only flag references that are truly UNRESOLVABLE without conversation history.\n\nCheck 2 — Implicit Contract: Does the prompt have ANY discernible goal? 'Explore the _output directory and find context files' IS a clear goal. 'Search for hooks that handle Task events' IS a clear goal. 'Read and summarize all files in X' IS a clear goal. Only flag if the prompt is truly goalless — e.g., a sentence fragment with no verb, or pure context with no request.\n\nIf both checks pass, return ok:true. When in doubt, pass — false negatives (letting a vague prompt through) are far less costly than false positives (blocking legitimate work).\n\nWhen returning ok:false, end your response with: 'Retry: Re-invoke the Task tool with a revised prompt that resolves the issues above.'"
