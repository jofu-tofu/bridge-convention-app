## Deployment

**Deploy = tag and push.** `git tag v<version> && git push origin v<version>` triggers the full pipeline:

1. GitHub Actions builds a Docker image (Rust/WASM → Vite → Caddy)
2. Pushes to GHCR (`ghcr.io/jofu-tofu/bridge-convention-app`)
3. SSHs into VPS, pins the version in `docker-compose.yml`, pulls, and restarts

**CI (`deploy.yml`)** runs on every push/PR: type-check, unit tests, lint, production build.
**Release (`release.yml`)** runs on `v*` tags: Docker build → GHCR push → VPS deploy.

**Rollback:** SSH to VPS, edit `/opt/bridge-app/docker-compose.yml` to a previous version tag, `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`.

**Required GitHub Secrets:** `VPS_HOST`, `VPS_USER`, `VPS_SSH_KEY`.

**Example URLs:**

```
?convention=nt-bundle&seed=42                          # Deterministic game
?convention=nt-bundle&seed=42&phase=review             # Instant review screen
?convention=nt-bundle&dev=debug,expanded,autoDismiss   # Max debug, friction-free probing
?screen=coverage&convention=nt-bundle                  # Coverage screen
?screen=settings                                       # Settings screen
```

- **CLI evaluation:** `npx tsx src/cli/main.ts play --bundle=nt-bundle --seed=42` runs session-based playthrough. Subcommands: `bundles` (list bundles), `modules` (list modules), `describe` (inspect bundle), `play` (session-based playthrough), `selftest` (strategy self-consistency). Same seed = same deal. Uses the same session API as the UI.
- **Bid button test IDs:** `data-testid="bid-{callKey}"` on all bid buttons — e.g., `bid-1C`, `bid-7NT`, `bid-P` (pass), `bid-X` (double), `bid-XX` (redouble). Container test IDs: `level-bids` (contract grid), `special-bids` (pass/dbl/rdbl row).

## Code Hygiene

- **Fix all lint errors and warnings you encounter** — even if they weren't caused by your changes. If `npm run lint` or a hook reports errors/warnings in files you touched, fix them before finishing.
- **Remove dead code after every change.** When a change makes code unreachable, unused, or semantically dead (reachable but its result is never consumed), delete it immediately — don't leave it for a follow-up. This includes: unused imports, functions, types, struct fields, enum variants, variables, parameters, feature flags that always resolve one way, and code behind conditions that are always true/false. Run `npm run lint:dead` (Knip) for TS and `cargo test --workspace` + compiler warnings for Rust. Do not comment out dead code or rename it with `_` prefixes — delete it.
- **Lint is scoped to app code, tests, and root JS/TS config files.** `npm run lint` is not a workspace-wide sweep; it excludes generated/tooling directories outside the app surface.
- **Lint enforces architecture, not just style.** ESLint guards key import boundaries (`engine/`, `stores/`, `cli/`, `components/`), the UI/backend boundary (components/ cannot import from any backend module -- must use service/), design token usage in game components (`no-hardcoded-style-classes`), and protocol trigger scope (`no-full-scope-trigger`). `npm run lint:dead` uses Knip for dead-file detection, with `static/dds/dds.js` ignored because it is loaded by the DDS worker via `importScripts()`.

## Conventions

- **Pure engine.** `src/engine/` has zero imports from svelte, DOM APIs.
- **Service is the sole interface for UI and CLI.** All UI components (`components/`, `stores/`) and CLI commands (`cli/`) must import exclusively from `service/` — never directly from `engine/`. Backend logic (conventions, inference, session) lives entirely in Rust. When adding new functionality the UI needs, expose it through `ServicePort` in Rust, then add the WASM binding and TS proxy method.
- **Svelte 5 runes.** Use `$state`, `$derived`, `$effect` — no legacy `$:` reactive statements
- **Named exports only.** No `export default` — for greppability
- **No `const enum`** — breaks Vite/isolatedModules; use regular `enum`
- **No `any` without comment** — annotate with `// any: <reason>`
- **No mocking own modules** — use dependency injection instead
- **PlayerViewport boundary.** Game phase components never access raw `Deal`. Everything the player sees flows through viewport types: `BiddingViewport` (bidding), `DeclarerPromptViewport` (declarer prompt), `PlayingViewport` (play), `ExplanationViewport` (review). Viewport builders live in Rust (`bridge-service`).
- **Callers own their types.** Service defines its own viewport/response types. Engine domain primitives (`Call`, `Card`, `Seat`, `Hand`) are acceptable to re-export since they are universal vocabulary.
- **Coverage optimization.** Tree LP computes minimal test sessions; two-phase algorithm (leaf sweep + gap fill) covers all (state, surface) pairs efficiently. Module interference detection uses static prefix-overlap analysis.
- **Test behavior, not implementation.** Tests assert WHAT code does (inputs → outputs), never HOW (internal calls, query strings, data structure choices). Litmus test: would this test pass unchanged if the internals were rewritten with a different algorithm? If no, rewrite the test. No `was_called_with` on internal methods; no asserting internal state.
- **Characterize before changing.** Before modifying code you don't fully understand, write tests that capture current behavior as-is. These are your safety net — run them after each change. Especially important for convention pipeline and bid-evaluation logic where subtle changes cascade.
- **No mocks for pure logic.** Engine, conventions, inference, and session logic are pure — pass data in, assert data out. If testing requires mocks, the code mixes logic with side effects; fix the design, don't add mocks. Mocks are acceptable only at system boundaries (WASM init, localStorage, DOM, network).
- **Red-Green-Refactor for new code.** Write a failing test first, then the minimum code to pass, then refactor with tests green. Do not write implementation first and tests after — tests written after implementation tend to mirror the implementation rather than specify behavior.
- **Playwright is for smoke, not matrices.** End-to-end coverage is intentionally small: app smoke, session-mode behavior, two representative bundles (Jacoby Transfers and Bergen Raises), and responsive shell checks. Do not add per-convention browser sweeps or seed matrices; put that coverage in service, Rust, or CLI tests instead.

## Design Philosophy

See `docs/design-philosophy.md` for the full set of 13 design principles and subsystem design rationale. See `TESTING.md` § TDD Philosophy for the decision tree, anti-patterns, and ranked priorities when principles conflict.

## System Parameterization

Multi-system support (SAYC, 2/1, Acol, Custom). Modules are system-agnostic — differences flow through `SystemConfig` → system facts → surface clause evaluation. `SystemConfig` and system fact vocabulary live in Rust (`bridge-conventions`).

**SessionConfig always carries a full `SystemConfig` + `baseModuleIds`** — same path for presets and custom systems. Rust never looks up configs by ID. The TS layer resolves the selected system via `resolveSystemForSession()` in `src/stores/custom-systems.svelte.ts`. Custom systems stored in localStorage (`bridge-app:custom-systems`). `SystemSelectionId` (`BaseSystemId | \`custom:${string}\``) is TS-only; it never crosses the WASM boundary.

**Point formulas:** `PointConfig` on `SystemConfig` defines point formulas per contract type (NT vs trump). The engine computes raw components (HCP, shortage, length); the fact DSL composes them via `compute_total_points()` in `fact_dsl/point_helpers.rs`. UI shows HCP only — formula-composed totals are for decision logic, not display.

**Base modules:** Presets use 4 always-active modules: `["natural-bids", "stayman", "jacoby-transfers", "blackwood"]`. Custom systems may use any subset (with `natural-bids` required). Base modules are merged into every `spec_from_bundle()` call (strategy layer) but NOT into `resolve_bundle()` (deal generation/teaching). Base modules affect bidding strategy only — inert modules never activate because their FSM triggers never fire.

## Architecture

**Dependency direction (hexagonal boundary):**

```
components/ → stores/ → service/ (WASM proxy) → [Rust: bridge-service → bridge-session → {bridge-engine, bridge-conventions}]
                         service/auth.ts → /api/* → [Rust: bridge-api → SQLite]
cli/commands/ → service/
```

UI layers (`components/`, `stores/`) import ONLY from `service/`. `service/` is a thin WASM proxy: `ServicePort` interface, `BridgeService` impl, barrel, `display/`, `util/`, `session-types.ts`, `auth.ts`. Nothing imports from `service/` except `stores/`, `components/`, and `cli/commands/`. `bridge-api` is independent of game crates — it handles auth and user data only (DataPort).

```

**Game phases:** BIDDING → DECLARER_PROMPT (conditional) → PLAYING (optional) → EXPLANATION. User always bids as South. `playPreference` (from practice mode) controls BIDDING exit: `skip` → EXPLANATION, `always` → PLAYING, `prompt` → DECLARER_PROMPT.

**Storage:** localStorage for user preferences (client-side). SQLite via bridge-api for user accounts, sessions, and server-side data (DataPort).

## Completed: Rust/WASM Migration

Backend modules (conventions/, inference/, session/, service/) have been migrated from TypeScript to Rust/WASM. All 5 phases are complete. TS `service/` is now a thin WASM proxy (~100 LOC). Convention logic, inference, session management, and viewport building all run in Rust.
See `docs/migration/index.md` for the phase tracker and architectural decisions. See `docs/product-direction.md` for the product decisions that drove this migration.

## Gotchas

- `npm run dev` builds WASM if `pkg/` missing, then starts Vite with HMR — the dev server stays running and reflects file changes instantly. Do NOT restart the server or browser after editing source files; just save and the page updates automatically
- WASM must build before Vite (`npm run dev` handles this automatically via `wasm:ensure`)
- **WASM required for browser.** All game logic runs in Rust via WASM. If WASM init fails, the app shows an error screen — no fallback. See `docs/gotchas.md` for details.
- WASM must be built via `wasm-pack` (not `cargo build`), because `wasm-pack` handles `--target web`, `.wasm` packaging, and JS glue generation
- Read a subsystem's CLAUDE.md before working in that directory
- Full testing playbook is in **TESTING.md**, not here
- Tailwind v4 uses `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin (no PostCSS config) — plugin goes before svelte() in `vite.config.ts`
- `vitest.config.ts` has `resolve.conditions: ["browser"]` so Svelte 5 `mount()` works in jsdom tests — don't use `require()` in tests, use ES imports
- Component tests use `@testing-library/svelte` — components needing context (stores/engine) need wrapper setup in test-helpers.ts
- Svelte `{#each}` blocks require keyed iteration (`{#each items as item (item.id)}`) per ESLint rule `svelte/require-each-key`
- See `docs/gotchas.md` for detailed technical notes (DDS browser, vendor/dds, convention system details, CLI enumeration, deal generation)
- **MC+DDS play runs entirely in Rust/WASM.** The DDS Worker callback is injected at service init via `wireDdsSolver()`. The store calls `playCard` and receives all AI plays regardless of profile — Expert/WorldClass use MC+DDS (async DDS via injected JS solver in `bridge-wasm`), Beginner/ClubPlayer use synchronous heuristic chain. MC sampling, evaluation, and suggest logic live in `bridge-session/src/dds/`. Expert samples randomly (no beliefs); WorldClass adds belief-constraint filtering (`PlayProfile.use_posterior`). Posterior inference (`PosteriorEngine` in `bridge-session/src/inference/posterior.rs`) uses rejection sampling against L1 `DerivedRanges`, 200-sample budget, wired into heuristics via `PlayBeliefs`.

**Context tree** (read the relevant one before working in that directory):

- `src/engine/CLAUDE.md` — engine types, DDS browser support, module graph
- `src/service/CLAUDE.md` — WASM proxy, display/, util/, session-types
- `crates/CLAUDE.md` — Rust workspace: 6 crates, serde contract, commands
- `src/cli/CLAUDE.md` — headless coverage test runner
- `src/components/CLAUDE.md` — component conventions, screen flow, Svelte 5 patterns
- `src/stores/CLAUDE.md` — factory DI pattern, game store methods, race condition handling
- `src/test-support/CLAUDE.md` — shared test factories, dependency rules
- `tests/CLAUDE.md` — E2E config, test running

**E2E policy:** Playwright exists to prove user-visible stability. Prefer adding browser coverage for routing, practice-mode/session semantics, autoplay/review lifecycle, and responsive shell behavior. If a proposed E2E test is mainly about convention correctness across many bundles or seeds, that is the wrong layer.

## Reference Knowledge (docs/)

The `docs/` folder contains decision history, design philosophy, architecture specs,
and detailed guides extracted from CLAUDE.md files. Agents do not need this context
for routine work. **Read from docs/ when:**

- **Making a design decision** with multiple viable approaches → read `docs/design-philosophy.md`
  to check if a prior principle already resolves it
- **Wondering "why is it done this way?"** about a non-obvious pattern → read `docs/gotchas.md`
  or the relevant subsystem doc
- **Adding a new convention bundle** → read `docs/convention-authoring.md` for the full
  checklist, templates, and common pitfalls
- **Working on inference/posterior (Rust)** → read `docs/architecture-specs.md` for open questions
  and spec status before implementing
- **Planning a large refactor** → read `docs/design-philosophy.md` + `docs/architecture-specs.md`
  to avoid violating architectural constraints
- **Touching CLI evaluation pipeline** → read `docs/cli-evaluation.md` for the two-phase
  design and known gaps
- **Modifying typography/layout tokens** → read `docs/typography-and-layout.md` for the
  full token system
- **Making UX, onboarding, or prioritization decisions** → read `docs/personas/README.md`
  and the relevant persona in `docs/personas/`
- **Product direction and deployment** → read `docs/product-direction.md` for monetization model,
  deployment architecture, two-port model, content protection strategy, and decision history
- **Rust/WASM migration** → read `docs/migration/index.md` for phase tracker, architectural
  decisions, and per-phase specs. Migration is complete; docs retained as architectural reference.

**Update docs/ when:**

- A design decision is made that future agents should know about → add to
  `docs/design-philosophy.md` or `docs/gotchas.md`
- A spec status changes (open question resolved, phase completed) → update
  `docs/architecture-specs.md` or `docs/roadmap.md`
- The target audience or user-needs framing changes materially → update
  `docs/personas/README.md` and the affected files in `docs/personas/`
- A non-obvious gotcha is discovered during implementation → add to `docs/gotchas.md`

## Context Maintenance

**Directory-level CLAUDE.md updates are mandatory.** When a session adds, removes, or renames files in a directory that has a `CLAUDE.md`, update that `CLAUDE.md` before committing. This includes:

- Adding new files to the architecture table
- Removing entries for deleted files
- Updating descriptions when module responsibilities change
- Bumping the `last-audited` date and `version` in the context-layer comment

Do not defer CLAUDE.md updates to a follow-up task. The update is part of the change.

**After modifying files in this project:** scan the entries above — if any claim is now
false or incomplete, update this file before ending the task. Do not defer.

**Add** an entry only if an agent would fail without knowing it, it is not obvious from
the code, and applies project-wide (not just one directory).

**Remove** any entry that fails the falsifiability test: if removing it would not change
how an agent acts, remove it. If a convention here conflicts with the codebase, the
codebase wins — update this file, do not work around it. Prune aggressively.

**docs/ knowledge base:** When a session makes a design decision, resolves an open question,
or discovers a non-obvious gotcha, update the relevant file in `docs/`. See § Reference
Knowledge above for when to read vs. update.

**Track follow-up work:** After modifying files, evaluate whether changes create incomplete
work, shift a phase status, or break an assumption tracked elsewhere. If so, create a task
or update the Phase Tracking table before ending the session. Do not leave implicit TODOs.

**Staleness anchor:** This file assumes `src/engine/types.ts` exists. If it doesn't, this file
is stale — update or regenerate before relying on it.

**Trigger Audit or Generate:**

- Rename/move files or dirs → Audit
- > 20% of files changed → Generate
- 30+ days without touching this file → Audit
- Agent mistake caused by this file → fix immediately, then Audit
