# Bridge Practice App

Bridge bidding convention practice app (1NT Responses, Bergen Raises bundles). Tauri 2 desktop + WASM browser (Vercel). Svelte 5 (runes) + TypeScript strict. Uses meaning-centric pipeline exclusively (old tree/protocol/overlay pipeline removed).

## Dev Tools (dev server only)

**URL params (9 consolidated params):**

| Param | Values | Effect |
|-------|--------|--------|
| `?convention=<id>` | `nt-bundle`, `nt-stayman`, `nt-transfers`, `bergen-bundle`, `weak-twos-bundle`, `dont-bundle` | Select convention → game screen. `?learn=stayman` resolves module-first (direct to Stayman module learning). `?learn=nt-bundle` resolves as bundle filter (shows that bundle's modules, auto-selects first). |
| `?learn=<id>` | module or bundle ID | Learning screen — module-first resolution, falls back to bundle filter |
| `?seed=<n>` | number | Deterministic PRNG seed. Advances per deal (42, 43, 44...). Reload resets. |
| `?screen=<name>` | `settings`, `coverage`, `profiles` | Direct screen navigation. `?screen=coverage&convention=X` for bundle-specific coverage. |
| `?phase=<name>` | `review`, `playing`, `declarer` | Skip to game phase instantly (auto-completes bidding, no animation). Requires `?convention=`. |
| `?dev=<flags>` | comma-separated: `debug`, `expanded`, `autoplay`, `autoDismiss` | DEV-only flags. `debug` opens debug panel. `expanded` opens panel + expands all sections. `autoplay` animates through phases. `autoDismiss` auto-retries wrong bids. |
| `?practiceMode=<mode>` | `decision-drill`, `full-auction`, `continuation-drill` | Select practice mode (default: `decision-drill`) |
| `?practiceRole=<role>` | `opener`, `responder`, `both` | Practice as opener, responder, or random per deal (default: `responder`) |
| `?targetState=<id>`, `?targetSurface=<id>` | FSM state / meaning surface | Coverage targeting (used by coverage tests) |

Backward compat aliases: `?coverage=true` → `?screen=coverage`, `?profiles=true` → `?screen=profiles`, `?debug=true` → `?dev=debug`, `?autoplay=true` → `?dev=autoplay`.

**Example URLs:**
```
?convention=nt-bundle&seed=42                          # Deterministic game
?convention=nt-bundle&seed=42&phase=review             # Instant review screen
?convention=nt-bundle&dev=debug,expanded,autoDismiss   # Max debug, friction-free probing
?screen=coverage&convention=nt-bundle                  # Coverage screen
?screen=settings                                       # Settings screen
```
- **CLI coverage:** `npx tsx src/cli/main.ts list --bundle=nt-bundle` runs headless coverage tests. Subcommands: `list` (enumerate atoms), `eval` (per-atom evaluation), `play` (playthrough evaluation), `selftest` (CI mode), `plan` (evaluation plan). Same seed = same deal across `eval`/`eval --bid`.
- **Compositional verification:** `npx tsx src/cli/main.ts verify preflight --bundle=nt-bundle --budget=fast` runs full structural health check (lint + interference + exploration + fuzz). Individual runtime stages: `verify explore`, `verify motif`, `verify fuzz`. Static checks (lint, interference) run as vitest tests and internally as part of preflight.
- **Bid button test IDs:** `data-testid="bid-{callKey}"` on all bid buttons — e.g., `bid-1C`, `bid-7NT`, `bid-P` (pass), `bid-X` (double), `bid-XX` (redouble). Container test IDs: `level-bids` (contract grid), `special-bids` (pass/dbl/rdbl row).

## Code Hygiene

- **Fix all lint errors and warnings you encounter** — even if they weren't caused by your changes. If `npm run lint` or a hook reports errors/warnings in files you touched, fix them before finishing.
- **Lint is scoped to app code, tests, and root JS/TS config files.** `npm run lint` is not a workspace-wide sweep; it excludes generated/tooling directories outside the app surface.
- **Lint enforces architecture, not just style.** ESLint guards key import boundaries (`engine/`, `inference/`, `conventions/`, `strategy/`, `stores/`, `cli/`, `components/`), the UI/backend boundary (components/ cannot import from any backend module -- must use service/), design token usage in game components (`no-hardcoded-style-classes`), and protocol trigger scope (`no-full-scope-trigger`). `npm run lint:dead` uses Knip for dead-file detection, with `static/dds/dds.js` ignored because it is loaded by the DDS worker via `importScripts()`.

## Conventions

- **Pure engine.** `src/engine/` has zero imports from svelte, tauri, DOM APIs, or `session/`.
- **Backend modules import from each other's barrels freely.** `engine/`, `conventions/`, `inference/`, `session/`, `service/` can all import from each other's `index.ts`. Deep imports into subfolders are still blocked for external consumers (conventions barrel enforcement stays). Frontend (`components/`, `stores/`) imports backend types only through `service/`. The service port wire format is the only frontend/backend boundary.
- **Registry pattern.** Use registries for conventions and strategies, not hardcoded switch statements
- **EnginePort abstraction.** UI communicates with engine through `EnginePort` interface; engine never imports UI
- **Svelte 5 runes.** Use `$state`, `$derived`, `$effect` — no legacy `$:` reactive statements
- **Named exports only.** No `export default` — for greppability
- **No `const enum`** — breaks Vite/isolatedModules; use regular `enum`
- **No `any` without comment** — annotate with `// any: <reason>`
- **No mocking own modules** — use dependency injection instead
- **PlayerViewport boundary.** Game phase components never access raw `Deal`. Everything the player sees flows through viewport types: `BiddingViewport` (bidding), `DeclarerPromptViewport` (declarer prompt), `PlayingViewport` (play), `ExplanationViewport` (review). Viewport builders and `EvaluationOracle` live in `src/session/`. Builders filter hands through faceUpSeats. `EvaluationOracle` is the answer key — only grading code touches it.
- **Service is the sole interface for UI and CLI.** All UI components (`components/`, `stores/`) and CLI commands (`cli/`) must import exclusively from `service/` — never directly from `engine/`, `conventions/`, `inference/`, or `session/`. `service/evaluation/` is an internal subfolder containing stateless CLI grading logic. ESLint enforces this for CLI commands; UI enforcement is in progress. When adding new functionality the UI needs, expose it through `ServicePort` or as a re-export from `service/index.ts` — do not add direct imports from backend modules.
- **Strategy contract types live in `conventions/core/strategy-types.ts`.** `BiddingStrategy`, `BidResult`, `BiddingContext`, `PlayStrategy`, `PlayContext`, `PlayResult`, `PosteriorSummary`, `PracticalRecommendation` — NOT in service/ or engine/ — because conventions/ imports them and placing them elsewhere creates circular dependencies.
- **Callers own their types.** Service defines its own viewport/response types (`BiddingViewport`, `ViewportBidFeedback`, `TeachingDetail`, etc.) rather than exposing internal types from backend modules. Engine domain primitives (`Call`, `Card`, `Seat`, `Hand`) are acceptable to re-export since they are universal vocabulary. Convention pipeline internals (`PipelineResult`, `ArbitrationResult`, `MachineDebugSnapshot`, `EvaluatedFacts`) must NOT cross the service boundary — create service-owned viewport types instead.
- **Coverage optimization.** Tree LP computes minimal test sessions; two-phase algorithm (leaf sweep + gap fill) covers all (state, surface) pairs efficiently. Module interference detection uses static prefix-overlap analysis.

## Design Philosophy

See `docs/design-philosophy.md` for the full set of 10 design principles and subsystem design rationale.

## System Parameterization

Multi-system support (SAYC, 2/1, Acol). Modules are system-agnostic — differences flow through `SystemConfig` → system facts → surface clause evaluation. `SystemConfig` and system fact vocabulary live in `conventions/definitions/`.

**Base modules:** Each base system has 4 always-active modules: `["natural-open", "stayman", "jacoby-transfers", "blackwood"]`. These are merged into every `specFromBundle()` call (strategy layer) but NOT into `resolveBundle()` (deal generation/teaching). Base modules affect bidding strategy only — inert modules (e.g., Stayman during Bergen practice) never activate because their FSM triggers never fire.

## Architecture

**Dependency direction (hexagonal boundary):**
```
components/ → stores/ → service/ (thin port) → session/ → {engine, conventions, inference}
cli/commands/ → service/
```
UI layers (`components/`, `stores/`) import ONLY from `service/`. `session/` is the domain layer — it must never import from `service/` (ESLint enforced). `service/` is a thin hexagonal port: `ServicePort`, barrel, `display/`, `util/`, `evaluation/`. Nothing imports from `service/` except `stores/`, `components/`, and `cli/commands/`.

**Game phases:** BIDDING → DECLARER_PROMPT (conditional) → PLAYING (optional) → EXPLANATION. User always bids as South. `playPreference` (from practice mode) controls BIDDING exit: `skip` → EXPLANATION, `always` → PLAYING, `prompt` → DECLARER_PROMPT. Details in `src/stores/CLAUDE.md`.

**V1 storage:** localStorage for user preferences only — no stats/progress tracking until V2 (SQLite)

## Gotchas

- `npm run dev` builds WASM if `pkg/` missing, then starts Vite with HMR — the dev server stays running and reflects file changes instantly. Do NOT restart the server or browser after editing source files; just save and the page updates automatically
- WASM must build before Vite (`npm run dev` handles this automatically via `wasm:ensure`)
- **No pure-TS EnginePort.** Browser=WASM (`WasmEngine`), desktop=Tauri IPC (`TauriIpcEngine`), no fallback. See `docs/gotchas.md` for details.
- Never build bridge-wasm via `cargo build --workspace`; always use `wasm-pack` to isolate feature resolution and prevent `getrandom/js` from bleeding into native builds
- Read a subsystem's CLAUDE.md before working in that directory
- Full testing playbook is in **TESTING.md**, not here
- Tailwind v4 uses `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin (no PostCSS config) — plugin goes before svelte() in `vite.config.ts`
- `vitest.config.ts` has `resolve.conditions: ["browser"]` so Svelte 5 `mount()` works in jsdom tests — don't use `require()` in tests, use ES imports
- Component tests use `@testing-library/svelte` — components needing context (stores/engine) need wrapper setup in test-helpers.ts
- Svelte `{#each}` blocks require keyed iteration (`{#each items as item (item.id)}`) per ESLint rule `svelte/require-each-key`
- See `docs/gotchas.md` for detailed technical notes (DDS browser, vendor/dds, convention system details, CLI enumeration, deal generation)

## Reference Knowledge (docs/)

The `docs/` folder contains decision history, design philosophy, architecture specs,
and detailed guides extracted from CLAUDE.md files. Agents do not need this context
for routine work. **Read from docs/ when:**

- **Making a design decision** with multiple viable approaches → read `docs/design-philosophy.md`
  to check if a prior principle already resolves it
- **Wondering "why is it done this way?"** about a non-obvious pattern → read `docs/gotchas.md`
  or the relevant subsystem doc
- **Adding a new convention bundle** → read `docs/convention-authoring.md` for the full
  checklist, templates, and common pitfalls
- **Working on inference/posterior** → read `docs/architecture-specs.md` for open questions
  and spec status before implementing
- **Planning a large refactor** → read `docs/design-philosophy.md` + `docs/architecture-specs.md`
  to avoid violating architectural constraints
- **Touching CLI evaluation pipeline** → read `docs/cli-evaluation.md` for the two-phase
  design and known gaps
- **Modifying typography/layout tokens** → read `docs/typography-and-layout.md` for the
  full token system

**Update docs/ when:**

- A design decision is made that future agents should know about → add to
  `docs/design-philosophy.md` or `docs/gotchas.md`
- A spec status changes (open question resolved, phase completed) → update
  `docs/architecture-specs.md` or `docs/roadmap.md`
- A non-obvious gotcha is discovered during implementation → add to `docs/gotchas.md`

## Context Maintenance

**Directory-level CLAUDE.md updates are mandatory.** When a session adds, removes, or renames files in a directory that has a `CLAUDE.md`, update that `CLAUDE.md` before committing. This includes:
- Adding new files to the architecture table
- Removing entries for deleted files
- Updating descriptions when module responsibilities change
- Bumping the `last-audited` date and `version` in the context-layer comment

Do not defer CLAUDE.md updates to a follow-up task. The update is part of the change.

**After modifying files in this project:** scan the entries above — if any claim is now
false or incomplete, update this file before ending the task. Do not defer.

**Add** an entry only if an agent would fail without knowing it, it is not obvious from
the code, and applies project-wide (not just one directory).

**Remove** any entry that fails the falsifiability test: if removing it would not change
how an agent acts, remove it. If a convention here conflicts with the codebase, the
codebase wins — update this file, do not work around it. Prune aggressively.

**docs/ knowledge base:** When a session makes a design decision, resolves an open question,
or discovers a non-obvious gotcha, update the relevant file in `docs/`. See § Reference
Knowledge above for when to read vs. update.

**Track follow-up work:** After modifying files, evaluate whether changes create incomplete
work, shift a phase status, or break an assumption tracked elsewhere. If so, create a task
or update the Phase Tracking table before ending the session. Do not leave implicit TODOs.

**Staleness anchor:** This file assumes `src/engine/types.ts` exists. If it doesn't, this file
is stale — update or regenerate before relying on it.

**Trigger Audit or Generate:**

- Rename/move files or dirs → Audit
- > 20% of files changed → Generate
- 30+ days without touching this file → Audit
- Agent mistake caused by this file → fix immediately, then Audit
