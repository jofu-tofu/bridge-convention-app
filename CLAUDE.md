# Bridge Practice App

Bridge bidding convention practice app (1NT Responses, Bergen Raises bundles). Tauri 2 desktop + WASM browser (Vercel). Svelte 5 (runes) + TypeScript strict. Uses meaning-centric pipeline exclusively (old tree/protocol/overlay pipeline removed).

## Dev Tools (dev server only)

- **URL routing:** `?convention=nt-bundle` jumps to game screen with that convention (IDs: `nt-bundle`, `nt-stayman`, `nt-transfers`, `bergen-bundle`). `?learn=nt-bundle` jumps to learning screen.
- **Deterministic seed:** `?seed=42` seeds the PRNG for reproducible deals. Seed advances per deal (42, 43, 44...). Reload resets.
- **Autoplay:** `?autoplay=true` auto-bids correct calls, dismisses feedback, and skips declarer prompts to reach Review phase instantly. Combine with convention: `?convention=nt-bundle&autoplay=true`
- **Target surface:** `?targetSurface=Z` exercises a specific meaning surface at target state
- **Coverage screen:** `?coverage=true&convention=X` opens coverage screen for a specific bundle
- **CLI coverage:** `npx tsx src/cli/coverage-runner.ts --bundle=nt-bundle` runs headless coverage tests
- **Bid button test IDs:** `data-testid="bid-{callKey}"` on all bid buttons — e.g., `bid-1C`, `bid-7NT`, `bid-pass`, `bid-double`, `bid-redouble`

## Code Hygiene

- **Fix all lint errors and warnings you encounter** — even if they weren't caused by your changes. If `npm run lint` or a hook reports errors/warnings in files you touched, fix them before finishing.
- **Lint is scoped to app code, tests, and root JS/TS config files.** `npm run lint` is not a workspace-wide sweep; it excludes generated/tooling directories outside the app surface.
- **Lint enforces architecture, not just style.** ESLint guards key import boundaries (`engine/`, `inference/`, `conventions/`, `strategy/`, `bootstrap/`, `stores/`, `components/`), design token usage in game components (`no-hardcoded-style-classes`), and protocol trigger scope (`no-full-scope-trigger`). `npm run lint:dead` uses Knip for dead-file detection, with `static/dds/dds.js` ignored because it is loaded by the DDS worker via `importScripts()`.

## Conventions

- **Pure engine.** `src/engine/` has zero imports from svelte, tauri, DOM APIs, or `strategy/`. Engine imports `core/contracts/` for cross-boundary types (`BiddingStrategy`, `BidResult`)
- **Contracts layer.** `src/core/contracts/` contains cross-boundary DTOs and strategy interfaces shared across module boundaries. Keep files domain-grouped; do not add types used by only one subsystem.
- **Registry pattern.** Use registries for conventions and strategies, not hardcoded switch statements
- **EnginePort abstraction.** UI communicates with engine through `EnginePort` interface; engine never imports UI
- **Svelte 5 runes.** Use `$state`, `$derived`, `$effect` — no legacy `$:` reactive statements
- **Named exports only.** No `export default` — for greppability
- **No `const enum`** — breaks Vite/isolatedModules; use regular `enum`
- **No `any` without comment** — annotate with `// any: <reason>`
- **No mocking own modules** — use dependency injection instead
- **PlayerViewport boundary.** Bidding phase never accesses raw `Deal`. Everything the player sees flows through `BiddingViewport` (`src/core/viewport/`). `EvaluationOracle` is the answer key — only grading code touches it.
- **Coverage optimization.** Tree LP computes minimal test sessions; two-phase algorithm (leaf sweep + gap fill) covers all (state, surface) pairs efficiently. Module interference detection uses static prefix-overlap analysis.

## Design Philosophy

- **Convention-universality is the litmus test.** When choosing between design approaches, ask: "does this work for all conventions — including ones we haven't written yet?" If you can imagine a convention where approach A breaks, A is the wrong approach. Never optimize for a single convention at the expense of generality.
- **Contain complexity through modularity.** Low impact radius (changes to one convention don't ripple), clean module boundaries (runtime/pipeline are separate subsystems), and convention-agnostic infrastructure in `core/` that never assumes convention-specific structure.
- **Semantic ownership: fields belong where they mean something.** Before adding a field to a type, ask: "does this describe what this type IS, or is it metadata about how something else uses it?" A `MeaningSurface` describes what a bid means — hand conditions, encoding, ranking. Table procedures (alerts), display concerns (formatted strings), and pipeline routing don't belong on it. Derive what you can from existing data; don't store what can be computed. If a field only exists to thread data to a downstream consumer, find a different path.
- **Bundle-specific knowledge stays in the bundle.** Core infrastructure (`core/`, `inference/`, `conventions/core/`) must not contain convention-specific fact IDs, heuristics, or special-case logic. If a behavior differs between conventions, the bundle declares it (e.g., `isPublic` on clauses) and the framework reads the declaration.

## Typography & Responsive Sizing

The game screen uses a **single-source typography system** so that card text, panel text, and table-interior text all scale from one computed base (`--panel-font`). This prevents font-size drift across viewports, orientations, and future features.

**How it works:**

1. **`--panel-font`** — GameScreen computes a px value from viewport width + table scale: `Math.max(12, round(rootFontSize * (0.5 + 0.5 * tableScale)))`. Set as a CSS variable on `<main>`.
2. **`--text-*` tokens** — em-relative CSS custom properties defined in `app.css :root`. They cascade from the local `font-size`, which is `--panel-font` in panels and a compensated value in the table.
3. **ScaledTableArea font compensation** — The CSS-transform container sets `font-size: calc(--panel-font / scale)`, so after the transform, text appears at `--panel-font` size on screen.
4. **Card text** — Uses `var(--text-value)` (1.2em), not a card-width ratio. Card rank/suit text matches panel `--text-value` in apparent size.
5. **Z-index hierarchy** — `--z-header` (10), `--z-tooltip` (20), `--z-overlay` (30), `--z-modal` (40), `--z-above-all` (50). Use `z-[--z-header]` instead of `z-10`.

**Token scale** (all em-relative, defined in `app.css`):

| Token | Value | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `--text-annotation` | 0.65em | Tiny: alert annotations on bids |
| `--text-label` | 0.75em | Section headings, muted labels |
| `--text-detail` | 0.85em | Secondary info, seat labels |
| `--text-body` | 1em | Primary readable content (= parent font) |
| `--text-value` | 1.2em | Prominent: card rank/suit, contract, trick count |
| `--text-heading` | 1.35em | Sub-section headings |
| `--text-title` | 1.6em | Screen titles, hero text |

**Rules:**

- **Game screen components MUST use `--text-*` tokens** (via `text-[--text-label]` Tailwind syntax or `font-size: var(--text-label)`) instead of hardcoded `text-xs` / `text-sm` / `text-base`. **Enforced by ESLint** (`local/no-hardcoded-style-classes` — error).
- **Raw Tailwind color-palette classes** (e.g. `text-red-400`, `bg-green-600`) are **banned** in game components. Use `--color-*` tokens from `app.css @theme` instead: existing semantics (`text-accent-success`, `bg-bg-card`), feedback palettes (`text-fb-incorrect-text`, `bg-fb-correct-bg/80`), phase badges (`bg-phase-bidding`), vulnerable seat (`text-vulnerable-text`), annotations (`text-annotation-announce`), supplementary notes (`text-note-encoding`). **Enforced by ESLint** (`local-colors/no-hardcoded-style-classes` — error).
- **Non-game screens** (ConventionSelectScreen, LearningScreen, etc.) may use standard Tailwind text classes for now — they scale with the root `clamp(16px, 1.5vw, 28px)`.
- **TypeScript typing:** `TextToken` type and `TEXT_TOKEN_CLASS` map in `src/core/display/tokens.ts`.
- **Do NOT add new hardcoded px font-sizes** to game components. Derive from the token scale.
- **ESLint rule:** `eslint-rules/no-hardcoded-style-classes.js` — bans hardcoded Tailwind text-size, raw color-palette, z-index (`z-10` etc.), and border-radius (`rounded-lg` etc.) classes. Scoped to `game-screen/` and `game/` (excluding debug components). All checks = error. Use `--text-*`, `--color-*`, `--z-*`, `--radius-*` tokens instead.
- **Border-radius:** Use `rounded-[--radius-sm]` / `rounded-[--radius-md]` / `rounded-[--radius-lg]` / `rounded-[--radius-xl]` instead of raw Tailwind `rounded-sm/md/lg/xl`. `rounded-full` is allowed (it's a shape, not a configurable radius).

## Pedagogical Architecture

The app separates two concerns: **deterministic convention teaching** and **probabilistic realism**.

- **Meaning pipeline** (fact evaluation → surface routing → meaning proposal → arbitration → encoding) defines the canonical answer key. Each `MeaningSurface` describes a bidding meaning with clauses evaluated against facts. `semanticClassId` and `teachingLabel` are required on every surface.
- **Alert system.** `resolveAlert()` derives alertability from `priorityClass`/`sourceIntent`. Public constraints are auto-derived from primitive/bridge-observable clauses via `derivePublicConstraints()`. `annotation-producer.ts` converts `publicConstraints` to `HandInference` for Layer 1 belief updates. Inference model: only hard constraints from chosen bid's clauses + entailed denials from within-module exhaustive closure policy. No cross-module soft inference.
- **`TeachingResolution`** (`src/teaching/teaching-resolution.ts`) wraps `BidResult` with multi-grade feedback: Correct (exact match), CorrectNotPreferred (truth set but not recommended), Acceptable (preferred/alternative tier candidates), NearMiss (same family, fails constraint), Incorrect. `resolveTeachingAnswer(bidResult, alternativeGroups?, intentFamilies?)` extracts acceptable alternatives and near-miss candidates. `gradeBid()` grades user input with 5-grade cascade.
- **`TeachingProjection`** (`src/teaching/teaching-projection-builder.ts`) projects arbitration results + provenance into teaching-optimized views for "why not X?" UI. Pedagogical relations and explanation catalogs flow end-to-end from bundle → config-factory → strategy → projection.
- **Grading is deterministic.** Same hand + same auction = same grade. No probabilistic scoring in V1.
- **Opponent modes:** "none" (opponents always pass) or "natural" (opponents bid with 6+ HCP and 5+ suit). Configurable via settings dropdown, persisted in localStorage.

## Roadmap

**Completed:** See `docs/roadmap-history.md`. Phases 4-10 (Decision Model Architecture, Competitive Auction Hardening, Boundary Hardening, Architectural Gap Resolution, Teaching Resolution Layer, Practical Bidder Layer, Meaning-Centric Bundles) are complete. Old tree/protocol/overlay pipeline fully removed.

**Active/upcoming:**

1. **Posterior Engine Boundary Redesign** — see `docs/posterior-implementation-plan.md`. Unblocks difficulty configuration and inference spectrum.
2. **User Learning Enhancements** — dedicated learning screen needs rebuild for meaning pipeline. Blocked on learning screen design spec.
3. **Difficulty Configuration** — UI for inference spectrum (easy/medium/hard). Blocked on posterior redesign.
4. **Convention Migration** — Migrate remaining conventions (SAYC, Lebensohl Lite) to meaning pipeline bundles. Lebensohl blocked on relay encoding spec; SAYC is a full base system.

## Architecture Spec & Alignment

**Design specs** (the authoritative vision for the full architecture):

- `~/Obsidian/Bridge Convention Vault/Sparks/2026-03-09-better-convention-protocol.md` — Agreement Module IR: composable convention modules, system profiles, conversation machines, two-phase evaluation, public state layers, WitnessSpecIR, FactCatalogIR
- `~/Obsidian/Bridge Convention Vault/Sparks/2026-03-09-better-candidate-pipeline.md` — Meaning-centric pipeline: MeaningSurface as canonical unit, semantic arbitration, TeachingProjection, DecisionProvenance, PedagogicalRelation graph, ExplanationCatalog
- `docs/posterior-implementation-plan.md` — Posterior engine boundary redesign: 8-phase plan covering FactorGraphIR, PosteriorQueryPort, PosteriorBackend, factor compiler, CI invariant tests, and Rust/WASM upgrade path

**Spec status:** Both specs are `status: active`, `confidence: medium-high`. Most contracts are frozen. The posterior engine boundary has a detailed implementation plan. Do not implement against unresolved areas — resolve the spec first.

**Open questions in the protocol spec:**

| Open Question | Status | Blocks |
|---|---|---|
| Posterior engine boundary redesign | **Phases 0-5 complete** — contracts, factor compiler, backend, query port, CI tests done. Consumer migration (Phase 4B) pending. | Inference spectrum / difficulty config |
| Fact catalog posterior compilers | **Subsumed** by posterior plan Phase 3 (factor compiler replaces `compilePublicHandSpace()`) | WitnessSpecIR wiring |
| Evidence group correlation model | **Design complete** — typed groups (Independent, ExclusiveAlternative, SharedSourceJoint, TemporalChain). Reserved in schema as Phase 7 (soft evidence). | Posterior combiner accuracy |
| Host-attachment activation | Spec designed, vocabulary resolved (`core/contracts/capability-vocabulary.ts`), not exercised by a convention yet | Negative Doubles, Fourth Suit Forcing |

**Alignment summary (as of 2026-03-15):**

| Area | Alignment | Key gaps |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Pipeline (selection, teaching, provenance) | ~97% | Evaluation runtime path live via `config-factory.ts` → `bundleToRuntimeModules()` → `evaluationRuntime` option. 5-grade taxonomy implemented. |
| Upstream (modules, profiles, machine) | ~80% | Profile-driven activation, submachines, two-phase evaluation all implemented. No host-attachment exercised. ActivationTrace always empty. |
| Posterior engine | ~70% (boundary designed and implemented, consumer migration pending) | Contracts, factor compiler, backend, query port, CI boundary tests done. Old `PosteriorEngine` → `SeatPosterior` path still works. Consumer migration (Phase 4B) pending. |
| Convention coverage | Patterns 1 + 3 + submachine | Stayman, Bergen, Weak Twos, DONT, Smolen. Patterns 2, 4-6 not yet exercised. |
| WitnessSpecIR | Types + test code exist | Not wired to deal generation. Raw DealConstraints used instead. |
| DecisionSurfaceIR migration | Adapter exists (test-only) | Pipeline still consumes MeaningSurface[], not DecisionSurfaceIR[]. |

**Next steps:**

1. **Posterior engine consumer migration (Phase 4B)** — Phases 0-5 complete (contracts, factor compiler, backend, query port, CI boundary tests, documentation). Next: migrate consumers (`meaning-strategy.ts`, `config-factory.ts`) from old `PosteriorEngine` → `SeatPosterior` to `createTsBackend()` → `createQueryPort()`. See `docs/posterior-implementation-plan.md`.
2. **Host-attachment** — exercise with Negative Doubles convention (vocabulary resolved, ready to implement)
3. **Convention content** — Lebensohl (relay encoding), Negative Doubles (host-attachment)
4. **Wire WitnessSpecIR to deal generation** (unblocked after posterior Phase 3)
5. **Migrate pipeline to DecisionSurfaceIR** (adapter exists — migrate consumption)
6. **Build the learning screen** (needs its own design spec — `docs/learning/research-summary.md` is research, not a spec)

## Test-Driven Development

This project follows TDD (Red-Green-Refactor, Kent Beck). All plans and implementations must follow this workflow:

- **Failing test first.** Write a test that fails before writing implementation code. No exceptions for "simple" changes — if it changes behavior, it gets a test first.
- **Behavior over implementation.** Tests verify WHAT code does, not HOW (Kent Beck / Michael Feathers). A test should pass unchanged if you rewrite the implementation with a different algorithm.
- **Test through public interfaces.** Don't test private methods or internal state. Test the contract the module exposes.
- **One concern per test.** Each test verifies one behavior. If it has "and" in the description, split it.
- **Characterization tests for unknowns.** When modifying code you don't fully understand, write tests that capture current behavior before changing it (Michael Feathers).
- **No test rewrites on refactor.** If a refactoring breaks tests, the tests were coupled to implementation — fix the tests to test behavior, then refactor.

## Testing Scope

**Run only the tests affected by your changes — not the full suite.** Vitest supports file-pattern filtering:

| Changed files in…              | Test command                      | When to use full suite                 |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `src/components/`              | `npx vitest run src/components/`  | Never for UI-only (CSS, props, layout) |
| `src/stores/`                  | `npx vitest run src/stores/`      | If store interface changed             |
| `src/engine/`                  | `npx vitest run src/engine/`      | If types/exports changed               |
| `src/core/display/`            | `npx vitest run src/core/display/` | If display utility signatures changed  |
| CSS-only / layout tweaks       | `npm run check` (type-check only) | Never                                  |
| Cross-cutting (types, exports) | `npm run test:run` (full suite)   | Always for type/interface changes      |

**Rule:** If you only changed `.svelte` files, CSS values, or added optional props — run targeted tests or just type-check. Full suite (`npm run test:run`) only when changing contracts types, store interfaces, or engine logic.

## Gotchas

- `npm run dev` builds WASM if `pkg/` missing, then starts Vite with HMR — the dev server stays running and reflects file changes instantly. Do NOT restart the server or browser after editing source files; just save and the page updates automatically
- WASM must build before Vite (`npm run dev` handles this automatically via `wasm:ensure`)
- **No pure-TS EnginePort exists.** Browser builds require WASM (`WasmEngine`); desktop uses Tauri IPC (`TauriIpcEngine`). If `initWasm()` fails, the app shows an error screen — there is no fallback. The TS engine modules (`deal-generator.ts`, `auction.ts`, etc.) contain all the logic but are not wired into an `EnginePort` adapter. Vercel deploys install Rust + wasm-pack via `scripts/vercel-build.sh` and produce a real WASM build. Stub files (`scripts/ensure-wasm-stubs.sh`) are retained as a fallback if the WASM toolchain is unavailable.
- DDS `solveDeal()` works in browser via Emscripten-compiled C++ DDS in a Web Worker (`dds-client.ts`). Par is always null in browser (mode=-1). `suggestPlay()` remains desktop-only. DDS WASM artifacts (`static/dds/`) are committed; rebuild with `npm run dds:build` (requires Emscripten).
- Never build bridge-wasm via `cargo build --workspace`; always use `wasm-pack` to isolate feature resolution and prevent `getrandom/js` from bleeding into native builds
- Read a subsystem's CLAUDE.md before working in that directory
- Full testing playbook is in **TESTING.md**, not here
- `vendor/dds/` is an upstream DDS C++ source checkout and `vendor/dds-patches/` holds local Emscripten/build patches for producing the browser double-dummy WASM bundle (`static/dds/`); app-level bridge logic in `src/` and `src-tauri/` remains clean-room
- Bergen Raises uses Standard Bergen (3C=constructive 7-10, 3D=limit 10-12, 3M=preemptive 0-6, splinter with shortage 12+)
- Only duplicate bridge scoring implemented (rubber bridge out of scope for V1)
- All conventions use meaning pipeline bundles — no tree/protocol/overlay pipeline remains. `ConventionConfig` is minimal (id, name, description, category, dealConstraints, teaching); convention logic lives in `ConventionBundle` with `meaningSurfaces`, `conversationMachine`, `factExtensions`, `pedagogicalRelations`, `acceptableAlternatives`, `explanationCatalog`
- Deal generator uses flat rejection sampling (no relaxation) with configurable `maxAttempts`, `minLengthAny` OR constraints, and `customCheck` escape hatch
- Tailwind v4 uses `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin (no PostCSS config) — plugin goes before svelte() in `vite.config.ts`
- `vitest.config.ts` has `resolve.conditions: ["browser"]` so Svelte 5 `mount()` works in jsdom tests — don't use `require()` in tests, use ES imports
- Component tests use `@testing-library/svelte` — components needing context (stores/engine) need wrapper setup in test-helpers.ts
- Svelte `{#each}` blocks require keyed iteration (`{#each items as item (item.id)}`) per ESLint rule `svelte/require-each-key`

## Context Maintenance

**After modifying files in this project:** scan the entries above — if any claim is now
false or incomplete, update this file before ending the task. Do not defer.

**Add** an entry only if an agent would fail without knowing it, it is not obvious from
the code, and applies project-wide (not just one directory).

**Remove** any entry that fails the falsifiability test: if removing it would not change
how an agent acts, remove it. If a convention here conflicts with the codebase, the
codebase wins — update this file, do not work around it. Prune aggressively.

**Track follow-up work:** After modifying files, evaluate whether changes create incomplete
work, shift a phase status, or break an assumption tracked elsewhere. If so, create a task
or update the Phase Tracking table before ending the session. Do not leave implicit TODOs.

**Staleness anchor:** This file assumes `src/engine/types.ts` exists. If it doesn't, this file
is stale — update or regenerate before relying on it.

**Trigger Audit or Generate:**

- Rename/move files or dirs → Audit
- > 20% of files changed → Generate
- 30+ days without touching this file → Audit
- Agent mistake caused by this file → fix immediately, then Audit
